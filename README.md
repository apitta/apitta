- 👋 Hi, I’m @apitta
- 👀 I’m interested in create digital solution that last for decades... in terms of technology, at this moment I'm interested in linux, java, python, fastapi, sqlalchemy, pandas, kubernetes, artificial intelligence, among others. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning many API's related to the financial market, like Anbima, B3, Vortx, Starkinfra and Grafeno. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a library to interact with anbima api. Give a easy way to users in general to connect their application to anbima api.
